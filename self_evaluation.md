1. How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
  - I feel pretty confident on Arrays! More practice can always help.
1. Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
 - My most pressing question is if there is a way to see the console in atom. To check my work I was copy and pasting it into replit to run. I will try to figure this out before moving to the next lesson!
1. What questions do you have about Arrays?
  - When looking up the different array methods I notices that on some examples `const` was being used instead of `var`. I'm wondering what the difference is?
  - I also saw the following example:
  ```javascript
  const plants = ['broccoli', 'cauliflower', 'cabbage', 'kale', 'tomato'];
  console.log(plants.pop());
// expected output: "tomato"
console.log(plants);
// expected output: Array ["broccoli", "cauliflower", "cabbage", "kale"]
plants.pop();
console.log(plants);
// expected output: Array ["broccoli", "cauliflower", "cabbage"]
```
I understand the use of the pop method in the `plants.pop()` but need to review the `console.log(plants.pop())`.
